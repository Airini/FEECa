# FEECa: Finite Element Exterior Calculus in Haskell

[FEECa (\['fi:ka\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fika_(Sweden)) is a library
implementing the mathematical framework that [the theory of finite element exterior
calculus (FEEC), developed by Arnold, Falk and Winther][arnold1], provides for the
discretization of partial differential equations (PDEs) that allows for a universal
treatment of a large number of physical problems.

[FEECa][docu] implements the abstract, mathematical concepts of FEEC and provides a
full-fledged basis form generated and framework for computations on differential
forms. It handles polynomial differential forms in arbitrary dimensions and
implements monomial as well as Bernstein bases for polynomials. The package
provides functionality to compute bases of the *P_r L^k* and *P-_r L^k* spaces
of finite element spaces based on the [geometric decomposition proposed by
Arnold, Falk and Winther][arnold2].

## The project

The project (Functional FEEC, initially) has been funded by the Information &
Communication Technology Area of Advance (ICT AoA) of Chalmers University and
is a collaboration between the Computational Mathematics (Department of Mathematics)
and Functional Programming (Department of Computer Science and Engineering) groups
at Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden.

The resulting implemented package has been developed by (you can find contact
information in the package description file: `feeca.cabal`):
- Simon Pfreundschuh: MSc student in Physics
- Irene Lobo Valbuena: MSc/doctoral student in Computer Science

as joint work with:
- [Anders Logg](http://www.logg.org/anders/): professor in Computational
  Mathematics
- [Patrik Jansson](https://www.chalmers.se/en/staff/Pages/patrik-jansson.aspx): professor in Computer
  Science. [github](https://github.com/patrikja)
- [Mary Sheeran](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~ms/): professor in Computer
  Science

## Documentation

The FEECa code is written using literate Haskell to combine source code and documentation.
The executable `doc` uses the [Hakyll](https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/) framework to compile
the code into a static web page and can be viewed in [your browser](localhost:8000) after
executing:

```
stack build feeca
stack exec doc rebuild
stack exec doc preview
```
