Differential forms may be defined in terms of alternating forms. Alternating
forms are antilinear transformations:

$$ \omega : V^k \rightarrow K $$

where $V$ is a vector space and $K$ some field. Whilst differential forms are
defined over some manifold $\Omega$ giving a corresponding alternating form per
point in said space:

$$ \eta : \Omega \times V^k \rightarrow K $$
